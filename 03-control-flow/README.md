# Control Flow

## 1. Isolate

Practice reading, visualizing, tracing, debugging, refactoring and writing small
programs with control flow structures and no user interactions.

## 2. Integrate

Integrate the skills from **Isolate** into larger programs that use
`prompt`/`alert`/`confirm` to interact with the user.

This collection of examples and exercises will also introduce different
strategies for processing user input and working with different primitive types
in an interactive program.

## 3. DOM UI

Apply your control flow skills in more complex event-driven programs that use
HTML, CSS & JavaScript to provide a full user interface.
