# Loop Control Strategies

This folder of examples shows 3 different strategies for writing Input/Output
loops. Find your favorite by solving each of the exercises 3 times, once with
each strategy. and of course you can mix and match!:

- **Boolean Flags**: Declare a variable with a boolean value and check it's
  value in the loop head. You can update the flag variable inside your while
  loop based on the user's input.
- **Logic in the Loop Head**: Write your loop logic directly in the while loop,
  checking something about your script's variables with each iteration.
- **`true`, `break`, `continue`**: Set your loop's conditional to
  `while (true) {` and control the input/output loop using `break` and
  `continue` in the body.
