/* Stepping Down

  Stepper Variables change systematically,
    going through a series of values for control flow

  "Stepper" describes how you are using a variable
    this term is not a JavaScript thing
    it's a general programming concept

  for loops are designed for stepping
    i is the stepper in this exercise


  fill in the loop condition and update the stepper variable
