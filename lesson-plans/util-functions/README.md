# Util Functions

Practice using pure functions stored in `/utils` to make your code easier to
understand and test.

---

## Prep Work

- Review `/es-modules/2-spec-files`
- Take a look through `/6-using-functions`
- Review _reference vs. value_ and _side-effects_.
- Take a look at objects from `/9-multiple-interactions`

---

## Learning Objectives

- ü•ö **Calling Functions**: You can call an imported function to complete a
  program.
- üê£ **Writing Functions**: You can write a function that is used in an
  (otherwise) working program.
- üê• **Refactoring Functions**: You can refactor code from a single-file program
  into a separate `/utils` function. And the program still works like before!
- üê• **Importing Reference Types**: You understand how multiple files of code
  can share the same data by importing an array. You know you understand when
  you can step through a working program in the debugger, using the Scope pane
  to show how the data is shared.

## During Class

### Before Break

- _All Together_: Study the examples from `./1-primitives`
  - How are `/util` functions used?
  - What is easier about using `/util` functions?
  - What is harder because of `/util` functions?
- _Small Groups_: Work on the exercises from `./1-primitives`
  - Try making small changes and seeing what happens!
- _All Together_: Recap! Each group quickly presents
  - what was hard
  - what went well
  - lessons learned

### After Break

- _All Together_: Study the first two examples:
  - How are _side-effects_ used to store and modify the user's data?
  - How can you use the Scopes pane in your debugger to see this?
- _Small Groups_: Continue studying the first two examples
  - If you have time, study the 3rd. How is it different from the second?
    Especially `remove-number.js`?
- _All Together_: Recap! Each group quickly presents
  - what was hard
  - what went well
  - lessons learned
