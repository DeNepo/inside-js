# Group Project Intro

In this class you'll study the starter repository for the
[Numbers Group Project](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/numbers-group-project),
form small groups (3-4) and prepare for the week's deliverable..

---

## Prep Work

- Come prepared to use object dot notation:
  - Reading a key/value pair: `obj.key`
  - Writing a key/value pair: `obj.key = __`
- Practice opening and stepping through one example program in this lesson plan.
  (any one will do, you can study the rest in class)

---

## Learning Objectives

### In-Class Practice

After studying the example programs you can:

- 🥚 **Module Files**: You can use the `type="module"` attribute in a `<script>`
  tag to load a JS file that uses `import`.
- 🥚 **Shared Data**: You can use the debugger to explain how data can be saved
  in an object between user interactions. (_hint: reference & side-effects!_)
- 🐣 **Entry Points**: You can use the debugger to show the two entry points in
  an interaction script:
  1. **Script Load**: The script is executed from top to bottom when it is
     loaded. (functions are declared, not called!)
  1. **User Interaction**: The handler function is called each time the user
     interacts with the program.
- 🐣 **Separated Logic**:
  - You can explain why it's a good idea to refactor a program's logic into a
    separate function with tests.
  - You can read and step through a program with separated logic.

### Project Prep

To prepare for the group project you can:

- [ ] 🥚 **Code Quality Scripts**: You can run all of the `npm` scripts in the
      starter repository to check your code's quality.
- [ ] 🥚 **Project Management**: You have set up a project board in your group
      repository with one issue per user interaction.

## During Class

### Before Break

- _All Together_: Read and step through 1-2 of the example programs.
  - What are the _entry points_ to each script file?
  - What functions/objects are declared in the script? Which are imported from
    somewhere else?
  - Where can you find different functions/objects in the Scope pane of your
    debugger?
  - How is the user's data processed? Is it stored between interactions?
- _Small Groups_: Continue studying the example programs.
  - Try making small changes and seeing what happens!

### After Break

- _All Together_: Read through the
  [Numbers Group Project](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/numbers-group-project)
  repository.
  - What code is already complete?
  - What code will you need to write over the week?
  - Demo how to run the scripts in `package.json`
- _Small Groups_: Form random groups of 3-4 people and prepare for the week.
  - Set up a group repository from the
    [project template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/numbers-group-project)
  - Practice running the `package.json` scripts on your local computers
  - Create a project board with one issue per user interaction

## After Class

- Continue studying your favorite tutorials and the exercises in this repo.
- **Deliverable**: Work with your group to complete as much of the Numbers
  project as you can.
