# Side-Effects

Learn about reference vs. value, and how to avoid side-effects in JS functions.

---

## Before Class

Study arrays and come prepared to use these language features in class:

- **Array Literals:** `const arr = [1, 2, 3];`
- **Array Indexes:** `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, ...
- **Basic Array Methods:** `.push`, `.pop`, `.shift`, `.unshift`
- **Array Iteration:** `for (const item of array)`

## Learning Objectives

- 🥚 **Reference vs. Value:** You can draw on paper how reference & value are
  represented in JS memory.
- 🥚 **Reference & Value Swaps:** You can both swap arrays between variables,
  and swap values between arrays.
- 🥚 **Deep vs. Shallow Comparison:** You know the difference between _deep_ and
  _shallow_ comparison and can explain when to use each one.
- 🐣 **Array Arguments:** You can draw what happens in memory when an array is
  passed to a function call in JS.
- 🐣 **Side-Effects:** You can explain how side-effects can happen when an array
  is passed to a function.
- 🐥 **Avoiding Side-Effects:** You can write functions that avoids side-effects
  by creating and operating on a new array.
- 🐥 **Testing for Side-Effects:** You can write a unit test that checks for
  side-effects in a function.

## During Class

### Before Break

- **All together:** Reference vs. Value
- **In Small Groups:**
  - swapping
  - deep comparing
  - array arguments
  - side effects
- **All Together:** Regroup with ~20 minutes left before break for each group to
  do a quick retro

### After Break

- **All together:** Testing Side-Effects
- **In Small Groups:**
  - exercises
- **All Together:** Regroup with ~20 minutes left before break for each group to
  do a quick retro
