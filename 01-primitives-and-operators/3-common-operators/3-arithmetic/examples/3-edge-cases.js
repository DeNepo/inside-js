/* Arithmetic Edge Cases

  there are a few special cases to be aware of with JS arithmetic

  you will never need to use these on purpose
  knowing these edge cases is important for debugging your code

  sometimes you'll see a NaN or Infinity show up in your program
  that's usually because you tried operating on bad values

  keep an eye out for these bugs!
