# Arithmetic

In these examples and exercises, you will be studying how JavaScript works when
doing math different types. You should **_never do this_** in your own programs.
The code in this folder is to help you understand how JavaScript works, not to
show best practices.

It's useful to practice strange math because sometimes you will find a bug like
this. Learning how implicit coercion works now with simple examples will help
you debug full programs later on.
