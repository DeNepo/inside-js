# Increment and Decrement Operators

These operators are very different from the operators you've studied so far.
They will update the value stored by the variable you're using with you writing
an assignment.

```js
let x = 1;
console.log(x);

x++;
console.log(x);

++x;
console.log(x);

x--;
console.log(x);

--x;
console.log(x);
```
