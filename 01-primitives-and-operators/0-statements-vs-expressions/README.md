# Statements vs. Expressions

In JavaScript a piece of code can be either a statement or an expression. It's
not important that you 100% understand the difference, just that you have a
basic idea:

- **Expressions** _evaluate_ to a value. This means you can write an expression
  on the right side of a variable assignment to store the value for later.
- **Statements** _do not_ evaluate to a value. This means if you try writing a
  statement on the right side of a variable assignment you will get an error.

Of course it's more complicated than that (it's JavaScript after all), but this
will get you far enough for now.
