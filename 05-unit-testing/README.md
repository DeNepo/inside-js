# Unit Testing

Learn how to read, write and run unit tests to describe and verify your
functions' behavior. You will focus on the _Behavior-Driven Development_
convention of using `describe`, `it`, and `expect(__).toEqual(__)`.

Exercises include writing tests for a working function, and writing functions to
pass a given test suite.
