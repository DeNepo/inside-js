## Learning Objectives

<details>
<summary>Priorities: 🥚, 🐣, 🐥, 🐔 (click to learn more)</summary>
<br>

There is a lot to learn in this repository. If you can't master all the material
at once, that's expected! Anything you don't master now will always be waiting
for you to review when you need it. These 4 emoji's will help you prioritize
your study time and to measure your progress:

- 🥚: Understanding this material is required, it covers the base skills you'll
  need to move on. You do not need to finish all of them but should feel
  comfortable that you could with enough time.
- 🐣: You have started all of these exercises and feel you could complete them
  all if you just had more time. It may not be easy for you but with effort you
  can make it through.
- 🐥: You have studied the examples and started some exercises if you had time.
  You should have a big-picture understanding of these concepts/skills, but may
  not be confident completing the exercises.
- 🐔: These concepts or skills are not necessary but are related to this module.
  If you are finished with 🥚, 🐣 and 🐥 you can use the 🐔 exercises to push
  yourself without getting distracted from the module's main objectives.
