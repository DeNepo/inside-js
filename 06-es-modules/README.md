# ES Modules

In this chapter you will learn one way to _export_ variables from one file, and
_import_ them to another.

ES Modules are a complex language feature with many syntax variations and
different usage conventions. We will focus on only one reliable and simple
approach so you can focus on your program's logic and structure. You will learn
how to:

- `export const name = __;` Export a constant variable from a JS file.
- `import { name } from '<file path>;` Import a constant variable into a file by
  name.

## 1. Import and Export

Practice reading, asserting and writing simple programs that export and import
values.

## 2. Spec Files

Learn how to use ES Modules to separate your functions and unit tests into two
separate files. Exercises include:

- _Refactoring_ functions and unit tests from one file to two files.
- Writing unit tests in one file to describe a function declared in a different
  file.
- Writing a function in one file to pass unit tests in a separate file.
