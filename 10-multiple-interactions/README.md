# Multiple Interactions

Learn how to structure your code when a program has more than one user
interaction accessing the same state.

## 1. Isolate

Learn how to use the JavaScript object data structure including: _access by
dot_, _access by brackets_, _ES6 shorthand_, _computed property names_, and how
to avoid side-effects when working with objects.

## 2. DOM UI

Study a few examples of programs that store their data in objects, and support
multiple user interactions with the same data. Pay special attention to:

- How the code is organized into separate files and folders.
- How side-effects are avoided when arrays are stored in objects.

Then go wild! What programs can you imagine building?
