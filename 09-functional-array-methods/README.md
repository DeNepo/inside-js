# Functional Array Methods

Learn how to use functional array methods in JavaScript to easily implement
common problem solving strategies and avoid side effects.

## 1. Isolate

Explore different concepts necessary to understand functional array methods,
without any user interactions:

1. **Array Strategies**: Functional array methods like `.map` and `.filter` are
   just one implementation of common problem-solving strategies. Take some time
   to learn the strategies with _imperative programming_ before moving on to
   function array methods.
2. **Callbacks**: Briefly explore how to pass functions as arguments, and how to
   call function arguments.
3. **Higher-Order Strategies**: Merge **Array Strategies** and **Callback** by
   exploring example functions that implement common problem solving strategies
   using callbacks.
4. **Functional Array Methods**: Finally! Study some examples that use
   functional array methods to solve simple problems.

## 2. Practice

Pass unit tests using functional array methods:

1. Write callbacks
2. Use callbacks
3. Write functions

## 3. Implicit Return

Briefly practice using arrow functions with _implicit returns_ when the function
body contains only one expression.

## 4. Integrate

Integrate your skills by refactoring your solutions from the **Arrays** chapter
to use functional array methods.

## 5. DOM UI

Challenge yourself by reimplementing previous array-based programs with a DOM
UI.
