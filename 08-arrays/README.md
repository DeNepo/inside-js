# Arrays

## 1. Isolate

Learn to read, visualize, trace, debug, refactor and write small programs with
arrays and no user interactions.

You will explore: different ways of _accessing array elements_, _`for-of`
loops_, _reference vs. value_, _copying arrays_ and _side-effects_.

## 2. Practice

Practice using arrays and avoiding side-effects by learning to unit test
functions that take arrays as arguments. This includes learning how to test
whether or not a function produces array side effects.

1. Write tests for functions that take arrays as arguments.
2. Fix bugs in tested functions that take arrays as arguments.
3. Write functions that take arrays as arguments and _do not_ produce
   side-effects.

## 3. Integrate

Integrate the skills from **Isolate** and **Practice** into larger programs that
use `prompt`/`alert`/`confirm` to interact with the user. You will write and
test your functions in a separate folder, and import them to the main program.

1. Import and use functions in your program from a separate file.
2. Write functions that are imported and called in a program.
3. Refactor portions of a program to a separate file as a reusable & tested
   function.
4. Reverse-engineer programs that use functions declared in a separate file.

## 4. DOM UI

Looking for a challenge? Try adapting each program from **Integrate** to use a
DOM UI instead of `prompt`/`alert`/`confirm`.
