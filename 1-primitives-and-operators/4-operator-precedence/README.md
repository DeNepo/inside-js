In JavaScript you will come across long expressions written in one line. This
code will become less mysterious after you understand Operator Precedence.

This chapter's exercises will help you internalize JS operator precedence.
Learning to read a long expression and see it as a series of single steps will
change your programming life.

In these exercises you will study strange and meaningless expressions, they will
use all the primitive types and do all sorts of ugly coercions. Keep in mind
that this is more challenging than code you will normally work with, and none of
this is good habits! The goal of these exercises is to practice understanding
difficult JavaScript expressions so when you come across them in the wild you
know what to do.
